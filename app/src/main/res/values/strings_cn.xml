    <string name="zofia_background">Born in Wroclaw, Zofia Bosak is the oldest daughter of Jan Bosak, former commander of the Polish Special Forces Unit GROM. While attending her father\'s military high school, she was pressured to perform on every level – a burden her younger sister was not able to cope with. \n\nDuring a school trip to the Masurian Lake District, Zofia was prey to a disturbing prank that almost cost her life. While she played in the lake, three boys from her class took turns trying to drown her, just for \'fun\'. This violent experience marked her with a deep mistrust of others. The following week, she has to sit beside her assailants in class. To deal with her growing anxiety, she decided to push her training further, and ensure she could rely on her skills for protection. Her father agreed to show her more ruthless techniques, given she would never question his methods. \n\nWhen Zofia hit legal age, she enlisted in the army. Among Zofia\'s most notable exploits is a rescue Operation in Guatemala, codenamed Red Agatha. A disastrous tropical storm formed a sinkhole in the middle of the city, swallowing an entire neighbourhood. Zofia was deployed to protect a team of scientists examining the perimeter. During a sudden landfall, she saved a child from disappearing into the abyss. To reward her ability to withstand hardships, Zofia received a medal and was promoted to Second Lieutenant. \n\nThroughout her experiences, Zofia forged a second family overseas. to have more impact on the field, she learned to trust her squad mates with her life, reconsidering the cruel lesson from the incident at Lakeland. Far away from her father\'s brutal training, Zofia let down her walls, developing close ties for the first time. She met her now-husband during a rogue operation in Mali, where they both mistook each other for hostiles.\n\nChallenged by her squad mates on the field, she discovered the true kind of specialist she wanted to become. At the peak of her career, she flew back to Poland for her wedding ceremony. The celebration was kept short, but Zofia quickly returned to Wroclaw for her maternity leave. Her arrival in Poland was soon followed by her father\'s sudden passing. \n\nThe birth of her daughter had a profound effect on Zofia, igniting her need to cocoon with her family – but Ela ignored her sister\'s attempts to reconcile. \n\nZofia returned to the GROM soon after hearing Ela would pass the selection. Except for her attempts to reconnect with her sister, Zofia kept her distance with everyone else. Her squadron noticed this change and wondered if her recent obsession with her father\'s pocket watch was a remnant of grief, or something more. \n\nWhen Ela accepted the prestigious offer to join Team Rainbow, Zofia saw no reason to stay behind. Everything about the GROM now seemed to remind her of her father. \n\nThree months later, Zofia became an official member of Team Rainbow.</string>

Kuh made life difficult for Grace, preventing her from exploiting her full potential. \n\nGrace heard about Rainbow during training exercises with the SAS, and it sounded like the opportunity she had been seeking... the chance to contribute through her strengths. She knew that Major General Kuh would never put her on the list, so she did what she always did and thought outside of the box. \n\nNow Dokkaebi is a member of Rainbow much to the surprise of Major General Kuh, who is not happy about it. He wants her drummed out of the White Tigers, but Dokkaebi could not be happier. She is among men and women who reward asymmetrical thinking even though she knows she now has a target on her back. More so, she is sure the other ROK operator, Chul Kyung Hwa, is spying on her. She needs to work twice as hard, but Grace feels twice as motivated now</string>
    <string name="dokkaebi_profile">Grace plays with expectation because she wants people to underestimate her, but it is different with Rainbow. Before she knew how to control the situation and was never afraid of failure until the stakes became this critical. Rainbow Six was her most daring stunt and she knows she\'s alienated herself from the Korean military; any slip up and this point will see her drummed out of the military entirely, and this has added pressure to perform, improve, and succeed.</string>

    <string name="dokkaebi_notes">Grace is sure that Chul Kyung Hwa was asked to monitor her, and it certainly does not help that he keeps telling her how to behave. In her books, he represents the old school thinking in the ROK Military but she does not seem distracted by her geek persona. It is not a factor with him. She tries to remain civil, but she knows her stuff and does not appreciate him trying to correct her behavior. Grace is on friendly terms with Echo, both of whom connect on matters of technology, but they also get competitive when it comes to outdoing each other in workshop. \n\nGrace utilizes the Ballistic Armor Military Laptop, codenamed Logic Bomb, which she used to hack enemy PDA tactical devices. That program downloads a virus of her making that can bypass firewalls, turning surrounding devices on and emitting a loud buzzing noise to compromise enemy position. The program is short and self erasing to prevent anyone from unraveling her code and building software to counter Logic Bomb.</string>

Two years later, he won the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC) and is known as having pushed the limits of what flying robots could accomplish.\n\nEnatsu was noticed by the National Police Security Bureau during his studies in Science and Engineering at the Tokyo Metropolitan University. Enticed to test his devices on the field, he entered the National Police Academy. A year later, he joined the Tokyo Metropolitan, Police Department Special Unit.\n\nEfficiency-obsessed and blunt, Enatsu is a talented officer despite his apathetic nature.

In Berlin, she studied Fine Arts, but her interest started to fade as the appeal of her old life slowly caught up with her. During her stay there, she made the acquaintance of the owner of a small private military company, who made her a job offer. Craving the adventure and financial independence, Ela accepted.\n\nWorking as a PMC in Iraq, Ela gained a reputation. Known to possess an impressive range of abilities, her attitude was the only obstacle standing in her way. While she was seen as a prized addition to any squad, her employers monitored her closely to investigate reports of authority issues. Four years into her deployment, she received the first news from home, which stated that her father had taken his own life.\n\nA few month's after her father's death, Ela terminated her contract and started training to pass the GROM selection as a civilian. Impressed by her determination and prowess on the field, the GROM saw in her a rare opportunity. Amidst the Polish Forces, she developed an expertise in Countering Threat Networks (CTN) and helped design advanced Exploitation methods to extract intel on a target's intentions and supply routes.\n\nOne of her most well-known ventures is Operation Orange Sky.

    <string name="vigil_background">Chul Kyung Hwa doesn\'t remember much of his childhood, only that his family was escaping across Asia as refugees? Or were they criminals? He remembers his older brother drowning during a river crossing. He remembers the safe house where they stayed trapped for over a month in near silence. He remembers their train ride when soldiers arrested two fellow defectors. He remembers his sick mother slowing them all down during the jungle crossing. He remembers leaving her behind as his father told him not to cry, not to make a noise and alert the armed patrols.\n\nThroughout it all, everyone impressed upon Chul Kyung that anything he said or any strange behavior would get them caught... it was life or death. So he buried his emotions deep, lest he betray his parents and be responsible for their capture; he became a stone to the outside world.\n\nGaining asylum in South Korea, it was not the happy life they\'d envisioned. The loss of his family proved too much for Chul Kyung\'s father, who committed suicide, leaving his son an orphan. Chul Kyung remained a stone, never showing emotion, never betraying his inner thoughts.\n\nChul Kyung was adopted into the Hwa family, who believed it best if he forget his past, which started by changing his full name to Chul Kyung Hwa. Chul Kyung was actively encouraged to forget his real name and he obliged. It was another form of camouflage. He grew up in a system of rules and codes of conduct, and they provided him with a reason to be stoic, to follow orders. He could hide behind the rules.\n\nChul Kyung wanted to give back to South Korea, the country that took him in, and he entered the ROK Navy, proving the exemplary sailor. He earned himself a berth in the ROKN UDT/SEALs, not only passing with distinction, but becoming such an exemplary operator in the course of his service that he was handpicked by the 707th Special Mission Battalion: White Tigers. He was diligent, methodical, and tenacious, albeit quiet. Naturally, his status as the child of defectors was not shared with his fellow soldiers to better give him a fair shot, but when South Korea was given an opportunity to send two operators into Rainbow, Chul Kyung was at the top of the list.</string>
    <string name="vigil_profile">Chul Kyung carries the scars of his childhood, where the only safe haven from the uncertainty of escape was to hide deep inside himself and become a stone. While a highly effective and competent by-the-numbers operator, it\'s made him highly uncomfortable in social situations. He is anxious when it comes to his own body language and expressions, how others might interpret his actions. He feels exposed, an open book that betrays all his secrets. Chul Kyung is most comfortable wearing his ballistic mask, where he feels he can actually breathe and hide another layer of protection.</string>

    <string name="lion_weight">1.85 M</string>
    <string name="lion_height">87 KG</string>
    <string name="lion_background">Olivier was born to a conservative, well-to-do family. His parents and older sister,Sophie, were in medicine and devout Catholics, but he bucked against their accomplishments and their faith. He was smart and arrogant, but he believed rebellion was a better use of his intellect. It was fun to act against expectation,to drink and party... At least it was until he got his girlfriend, Claire, pregnant.\n\nHe tried to convince Claire to get an abortion, but she refused. Once his parents found out about the pregnancy, they kicked him out of the house ; it was the last straw in a string of bad behavior. Depressed, Olivier went on a drug and alcohol-fueled bender, getting trashed enough to land in the hospital. That was his wakeup call. He was 18 and nearly homeless, so he joined the French Army out of desperation. He needed purpose.\n\nMilitary life was hard but rewarding. Olivier took solace in purpose and struggled to break old habits. He started sending money to Claire to support their newborn son even though she did not want to see Olivier. He became a second-level in-combat rescuer, and joined the 2nd Dragoon Regiment in their role as a CBRN reaction force. He also developed a close relationship with the regiments Catholic Chaplain, Bertrand, who eventually spoke to Claire and convinced her that Olivier regretted his actions. He arranged a reunion for them.\n\nIt was a hard moment for Olivier. He met his son, Alexis, the child he wanted aborted, and the reality of his decision hit him hard. He had been selfish, pushing his girlfriend to do something because it inconvenienced him. More so, Claire was about to get married and Alexis was already calling someone else \'daddy\'. Everything he had done, putting his loved ones through hell, shoved him into a wild depression that almost cost him his rank. Chaplain Bertrand helped Olivier through his crisis and with it, he returned to the Catholic Church. \n\n\ Olivier swore he would do everything possible to rectify the pain he had caused,so he worked harder, and sought more challenges. He qualified to join the Grouped\'intervention de Ia Gendarmerie nationale (GIGN) as their new biohazard expert using drones to maintain and hold quarantine perimeters. He focused on his duty ,on making things right, no matter how much it hurt him in the process. His feelings were irrelevant what mattered was strict observation of his duty. During a Yellow Fever outbreak in Sudan, while protecting a field investigation team, his loud voice scared a frightened mob back and he gained the nickname "Lion" from the locals. \n\nIn 2015, the army asked him to lead the 2nd Dragoons to West Africa to assist medical personnel fighting the Ebola epidemic. Tragedy ensued, and the decisions Olivier made for safety reasons put him at odds with Doc, who blamed him for the death of several medical personnel on-site including Doc's colleague. The tension between the two continues to this day in Team Rainbow. \n\nAfter studying his Jacket, Finka recommended Olivier for Rainbow as a CBRN specialist, and Six agreed. Olivier immediately proved his value when Finka and he uncovered the source of the mysterious mist that came ashore in Sussex and poisoned people, though he claims he shares that success with Twitch, who provided him with the new aerial drone to locate the mist plume. \n\nOlivier has managed to stay in his son's life, but it is an awkward relationship. Alexis does not know how to call him father and Olivier is not sure what it means to be a dad in the day-to-day. He has mended bridges with his parents and sister, his return to the Catholic faith healing those wounds, and while his decision to be a soldier bothers them, he is no longer the thoughtless rebel. He is not a soldier to make life easy on his soul. He bears the weight of responsibility for, what he has done even though Bertrand constantly reminds him that
forgiveness is in the heart of God.</string>
    <string name="lion_profile">Lion is a by-the-books Operator because he doesn\'t trust his civilian instincts. Rules give him structure and allow him to control what he considers the pettier parts of his personality. They give him a safety net when conscience or arrogance could otherwise weaken his resolve and hurt more lives. He bears the weight of responsibility for what he has done and pushes himself to the limits as a form of corporeal punishment. Unfortunately, he is arrogant and has rubbed some people within GIGN and Rainbow the wrong way. Doc thinks he lacks the empathy necessary to help in medical crises while Lion thinks Doc\'s humanitarianism is a liability. Twitch is not happy about being caught in the middle of that fight. His closest friend in GIGN is Montagne, but when Thatcher punched him after he said the wrong thing during a training exercise, Lion almost brought the GIGN
and SAS to blows.

    <string name="finka_weight">1.71 M</string>
    <string name="finka_height">68 KG</string>
    <string name="finka_background">Lera was nine when she was diagnosed with a neuropathy that included the slow degeneration of muscles and the loss of sensation in the limbs and extremities.Born three years after the Chernobyl disaster in the irradiated city Gomel, Belarus, she grew up around children already suffering from birth defects. Her diagnosis was the realization of her fears, so when her parents encouraged her and her younger siblings to be physically active, she pushed herself even harder, determined to keep her body in peak condition to weather the neuropathy. She could not be sick if she stayed healthy, her young mind reasoned. \n\nAll three Melnikova children grew up playing sports, with Lera excelling at those requiring agility and finesse but there was always the knowledge that the neuropathy would worsen unless someone found a more permanent solution. She decided that someone was herself.\n\nLera moved to Novosibirsky State University and graduated with a PhD. in Microbiology and Immunology. She remained at NSU in the Biotechnology and Virology Laboratory, her research uncovering treatments for a variety of pathogens and neuropathies including her own through drugs and self-dissolving nanites. While she hadn\'t found a cure, she had found remission.\n\nLera might have stayed in Academia had she not received a visit from the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB).. Russian Spetsnaz  operators and special agents faced the ever-growing danger of exposure to hazardous materials including organophosphorus agents like VX gas. For the first me in her life, Lera began thinking outside of her own concerns. Her research ad saved the lives of perfect strangers, and now they were reaching out to her, sending grateful postcards and photos and letters. She could have a greater impact still. Lera jumped at the chance to work with Spetsnaz volunteers in a variety of conditions as she adapted the nanobots to their high-performance physiologies. Quickly, she came to enjoy the sense of competition, camaraderie, and the mental toughness of the Russian Special Forces members. She joined the Army with an eye on becoming a Red Beret herself, on the front lines of saving lives as a Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) specialist.  \n\n Serving in the Russian Army, Lera rapidly proved herself physically and mentally tough enough to try out for the Spetsnaz. It was a brutal course, culminating in Close quarter Battle (CQB) knife training with Kapkan. A misstep and a flourish from Kapkan, however, opened her face from brow to cheek, but Lera went for a series of bone breaking punches to his nose and ribs before the pain overwhelmed her. They spent the night in the med tent, neither of them speaking, but enjoying a new, unspoken respect between them. From that day forward, she'd earned her moniker, Finka or \"Knife\". Lera became the Spetsnz CBRN Specialist, joining the Vympel UNit under the FSB and using her nanobots to help her unit survice hot zones; she was one of the only people capable of tailoring the nanobots to specific operators.\n\nHer work in restructuring Russian battlefield protocols in the handling and neutralization of dangerous payloads earned her notice, and she became the go-to expert when it came to joint exercises with the other CTUs. Six invited Lera to help Rainbow Six put together a CRBN unit of their own with Olivier \"Lion\" Flament as her first pick.</string>
    <string name="finka_profile">Lera discovered that her neuropathy was slowly growing resistant to treatment. The old fears returned, every ache and pain analysed and scrutinized as she
pushed herself even harder to peak performance.\n\nShe constantly tweaks and modifies her formula to stave off twinges and numbness that she imagines might be the onset of decline. She pushes herself to the point of throwing up after workouts with IQ and Valkyrie, though only Valkyrie understood that punishing limit of physical fitness. Lera is unable to distinguish between the disease and normal fatigue and is driven by he? fears and made excellent by them in the same maddening moment. She is not young anymore, though, but more desperate than ever to hold on to her life. She is trying to find anew treatment while keeping it a secret, but Doc knows and is closely monitoring her condition in case it begins to affect her performance. She has not shared this with anyone else, not Kapkan who is her no-nonsense mentor, and not Tachanka with whom she drinks and flirts.</string>

    <string name="sas">The Special Air Service (SAS) is a special forces unit of the British Army. The SAS was founded in 1941 as a regiment, and later reconstituted as a corps in 1950.The unit undertakes a number of roles including covert reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, direct action and hostage rescue. Much of the information and actions regarding the SAS is highly classified, and is not commented on by the British government or the Ministry of Defense due to the sensitivity of their operations.\n\nThe corps currently consists of the 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, the regular component under operational command of United Kingdom Special Forces, as well as the 21st (Artists) Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve) and the 23rd Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve), which are reserve units under operational command of the 1st Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade.\n\nThe Special Air Service traces its origins to 1941 and the Second World War. It was reformed as part of the Territorial Army in 1947, named the 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Artists Rifles). The 22nd Special Air Service Regiment, which is part of the regular army, gained fame and recognition worldwide after its televised rescue of all but one of the hostages held during the 1980 Iranian Embassy siege.</string>
    <string name="fbi">FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams are specialized tactical teams (SWAT) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). SWAT agents are specially trained to intervene in high-risk events like hostage and barricade situations.The FBI maintains SWAT teams at each of its 56 field offices throughout the country varying in size up to about 42 members.In the event of a large scale problem that local law enforcement does not have the resources to handle, FBI SWAT teams from the local field office, as well as outside the local region can be dispatched to aid the local authorities.\n\nTheir field of action are High risk arrests and assaults (armed and dangerous subjects), Hostage rescue ,Car stops, Counter-terrorism, Maritime Operations, Tubular assaults (aircraft, trains, buses, etc.), Stronghold assaults (structures requiring specialized breaching equipment that local law enforcement might not have access to), Fugitive tracking (in rural environments) , Operations in WMD environments, Dignitary protection, Coordinate multi-location warrant service, Site surveys for high visibility events, Aircraft Hijackings, Specialized sniper operations.</string>
    <string name="gign">GIGN (Groupe d\'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale)is the elite Police tactical unit of the French National Gendarmerie.Its missions include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, surveillance of national threats, protection of government officials, and targeting organized crime. \n\nGIGN was established in 1974 following the Munich massacre. Created initially as a relatively small tactical unit specialized in sensitive hostage situations, it has since grown into a larger and more diversified force of nearly 400 members, with expanded responsibilities. GIGN shares jurisdiction of French territory with the National Police special-response units. \n\nGIGN is headquartered in Versailles-Satory near Paris. Although most of its operations take place in France, the unit, as a component of the French Armed Forces, can operate anywhere in the world. Many of its missions are secret, and members are not allowed to be publicly photographed. Since its formation, GIGN has been involved in over 1,800 missions and rescued more than 600 hostages, making it one of the most experienced counter-terrorism units in the world.</string>
    <string name="spetznaz">Spetsnaz is an umbrella term for special forces in Russian and is used in numerous post-Soviet states.\n\nHistorically, the term referred to special military units controlled by the military intelligence service GRU (Spetsnaz GRU). It also describes special purpose units, or task forces of other ministries (such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs ODON and Ministry of Emergency Situations\' special rescue unit) in post-Soviet countries.\n\nAs Spetsnaz is a Russian term, it is typically associated with the special forces units of Russia, but other post-Soviet states often refer to their special forces by the term as well since they inherited their special purpose units from the now-defunct Soviet security agencies. The 5th Spetsnaz Brigade of Belarus or the Alpha Group of the Security Service of Ukraine are both such examples of non-Russian Spetsnaz forces.\n\nIn post-Soviet Russia "Spetsnaz" became a colloquial term as special operations (spetsoperatsiya), from police raids to military operations in internal conflicts, grew more common. Coverage of these operations, and the celebrity status of special operations forces in state-controlled media, encouraged the public to identify many of these forces by name: SOBR, Alpha, Vityaz. The term Spetsnaz has also continued to be used in several other post-Soviet states such as Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan for their own special operations forces. </string>
